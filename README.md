# WOS Battle Simulator — Monorepo

A monorepo for simulating and calibrating Whiteout Survival (WOS) battles. It
is organized around three primary components plus shared data and documentation.

```

## Expedition Simulator Mk2

The [Mk2 integration guide](docs/mk2-integration.md) describes the opt-in replay engine,
seed provenance, and reproducible checks. The original 160 captured cases live in
[`testcases/mk2/controlled.json`](testcases/mk2/controlled.json), with a
[readable report catalog](docs/mk2-controlled-reports.md). The [installed catalogue18 checkpoint](docs/installed-catalogue18-validation-20260914.md) reproduces **496/496 reviewed controlled reports exactly**, checking winners, all six survivor counts and every explicitly recorded supported chance-skill count. Two narrowly scoped Ambusher RNG corrections resolve the 25 historical catalogue17 mismatches; the previous 471 reports retain their complete outputs and RNG. No troop stats, probabilities or normal attack order changed in this update. Recorded seeds and genuine captured timestamps remain separate, including known timestamp-plus-one exceptions. Separate external inbox cases still include mismatches and unsupported profiles. Earlier [campaign evidence](docs/mk2-campaign-20260913.md), the [catalogue17 baseline](docs/mk2-reviewed-checkpoint-496-20260914.md) and [research notes](docs/mk2-pending-research.md) preserve development history. All controlled replay inputs, recorded seeds and available observations are included under `testcases/mk2/`; raw identifying network captures remain private.

## Components

### `simulator/` — the primary simulator

The current, authoritative battle engine. Written in TypeScript and run with
`tsx` (no build step required for dev). It powers in-browser simulation in the
dashboard and the parity/tournament tooling.

```bash
cd simulator
npm test                    # unit + testcase parity suite
npm run typecheck
npx tsx ../scripts/run_testcases.ts --save-snapshot --db-ingest # save run and add to dashboard history
npx tsx ../scripts/run_testcases.ts --human --generate-charts   # summary plus stochastic distribution charts
```

Simulator-backed operational scripts live at the repo root:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/tournament_dual_swiss.ts
npx tsx scripts/benchmark_tournament_battle_modes.ts 60
npx tsx scripts/fit_enemy_base_stats.ts --help
```

Config (troop/hero stats, hero definitions) lives in `simulator/config/`. The
dashboard imports the engine through the `@simulator/*` path alias, which resolves to
`simulator/src/*` (alias name kept for continuity). Hero JSON files are the sole
catalogue: Node tools discover them from the directory at runtime, and the
dashboard discovers and bundles the same directory through Webpack. There is no
generated manifest or separate registration step.

### `dashboard/`

A Next.js app (`dashboard/web/`) with TypeScript SQLite ingestion and Python OCR
helpers. The dashboard reads parity reports and the SQLite run history;
current runs are generated from the CLI with
`npx tsx scripts/run_testcases.ts --save-snapshot --db-ingest`. Saved testcase
run artifacts include stochastic distribution charts, available from the
Run Reports page's Charts tab. In-browser simulation runs the TypeScript engine
in a web worker.

```bash
cd dashboard/web
npm ci
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:3000
npm run build && npm test
```

See [`README_DASHBOARD.md`](README_DASHBOARD.md) and
[`dashboard/README.md`](dashboard/README.md).

### `skill/`

The self-contained `wos` agent skill that automates the game on MuMuPlayer
emulators via ADB (`skill/scripts/wosctl`). Everything the skill needs at
runtime (OCR model, templates, data, knowledge) lives inside `skill/`. The one
intentional outward write is `run-testcase`, which appends captured fixtures to
the root `testcases/` corpus. See [`skill/SKILL.md`](skill/SKILL.md).

## Data layout

- **`simulator/config/`** — the simulator schema (hero definitions, troop stats/skills,
  hero generation stats). Authoritative for the current simulator.
- **`shared/fighters_data/`** — fighter stat profiles (plain numeric stat
  tables), read by simulator-backed scripts.
- **`testcases/`** — the ground-truth calibration corpus. It intentionally lives
  at the repo root rather than under `shared/`: its path string is a stable
  logical id baked into the calibration DB, waivers, and parity-report
  normalization, so moving it would churn historical identities. `simulator/`
  reaches it through a `simulator/testcases -> ../testcases` symlink.

## Development

```bash
# Python (shared venv at repo root)
uv sync
uv run pytest                      # skill and OCR Python tests

# TypeScript
cd simulator && npm test
cd dashboard/web && npm ci && npm test
```

Docker dev/prod compose files at the repo root bind-mount the component trees
into the container; see `docker-compose.yml` / `docker-compose.prod.yml`.
